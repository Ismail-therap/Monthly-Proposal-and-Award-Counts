The PI will include the REDD email in the reply. This is a renewal/extension of work WYSAC has been doing since 2019 (contracts attached). We are getting additional funds for an additional year of work. Review of and signatures on the included summary budget documents are all that is required--not a full proposal. The total budget amount was set by the client, and we have matched it. The proposed travel budget includes the best estimates for plans that cannot be firm at this point. For example, the CDC has not announced details about the possible kick-off meetings. We have done the best we can to estimate reasonable costs, but actual travel is likely to deviate from the proposed budget.

2nd - According to BOR’s proposal ranking criterion (pg. 27 of the FOA), if we don’t provide cost share, the best score we can get is 90%, which will put our proposal at a bad place at the beginning within a very competitive system, now matter how good the proposal is 
3rd  -   NMT is the leading organization.  They asked us to provide the matching.  Please note that NMT provides real cash as a match, while we just use our research time as a match.
4th -   To reduce UW’s matching percentage, we have a company to provide 25% matching, while UW provides 25% matching.  Please note that typical DOE FOAs ask at least 20% matching.  A lot of DOE proposals show more than 20% matching, although we do not do it.  

The cost-effectiveness versus the expected benefits of the potential project includes –
Firstly, we have much higher chance to win the award because we will not lose 10 score point if we do NOT provide matching according BOR (funding organization).  Otherwise, we just waste time to prepare the proposal.  The competition is very strong.
Secondly, any water projects (including this one) is very important to Wyoming because Wyoming is lacking in water resources.  Frankly speaking, water projects are more important than energy projects in Wyoming.  Wyoming is rich in energy resources; however, it is lacking in water resources.  As a matter of fact, I just met the leader of Laramie Drinking Water Treatment Plant in last week, I was very taken back by knowing how poor Laramie’s drinking water resources are when Mike (manager) talked to me how much effort Laramie city has made and has paid to purchase water right to guarantee the water supply for Laramie people in every year.",,,,,,,,,,,,"11/10/2023 11:01:26 AM: Proposal has been submitted to sponsor >> 5/14/2025 04:27:46 PM: No evidence for further work on this.",2023-11-10 11:01:26,,,2025-05-14 16:27:46,"FY2024",,,"FY2025",2023-10-26 11:47:46,"FY2024",15,,551,"November-2023","Engineering","Q2 FY2024",,"Federal","Others","Submitted",1,0,1,0

The normal negotiated federal indirect cost rate for the University of Wyoming (UW) is 44.5%. However, UW is a CESU partner. As such, the indirect cost rate for this project will be 17.5%. We have included matching funds based on the difference between these two indirect cost rates (i.e., 44.5% - 17.5% = 27%). These matching funds are derived by multiplying the percent difference between the indirect rates (i.e., 27%) by the indirect cost base (total direct costs minus student tuition/fees).",,,,,,,,,,,,"2/23/2024 05:05:34 PM: Submitted. >> 8/14/2024 10:59:24 AM: NOA rec'd",2024-02-23 17:05:34,,2024-08-14 10:59:24,,"FY2024",,"FY2025",,2024-01-25 10:25:43,"FY2024",30,173,,"February-2024","Engineering","Q3 FY2024","Q1 FY2025","Federal","Others","Funded",0,1,1,63173.77

Following are details provided by them:

Good afternoon!

So, I included a PowerPoint overview of the HCBS measures set that CMS is, ""proposing."" I've also included the CMS CAHPS Home and Community Based Services Survey, as well as the data analysis guide. This hopefully will give you a better picture of what we are looking at and what it will take to accomplish. We also haven't been given the complete picture from CMS yet, but this is as much information as we have at the moment while reading between the lines. Feel free to ask any questions or if you have any concerns. Thank you!

Sample size: With approximately 2400 members on waiver, a confidence level of 95% with a +/-5% margin of error would require a recommended sample size of 332.
Mode: Based on the survey type/analysis guide, I would think the best results would come from a phone call, with a similar approach as the Montana Medicaid survey. However, we are definitely open to ideas from the subject matter experts.
Contact List: We can provide a random sample and contact list for those sample members.
Timeline: Completed annually, our first waiver year out of five waiver years, would begin next year.

Collaborative Proposals

A collaborative proposal is one in which investigators from two or more organizations wish to collaborate on a unified research project. Collaborative proposals may be submitted to NSF in one of two methods: as a single proposal, in which a single award is being requested (with subawards administered by the lead organization); or by simultaneous submission of proposals from different organizations, with each organization requesting a separate award. In either case, the lead organizationï¿½s proposal must contain all of the requisite sections as a single package to be provided to reviewers (that will happen automatically when procedures below are followed). All collaborative proposals must clearly describe the roles to be played by the other organizations, specify the managerial arrangements, and explain the advantages of the multi-organizational effort within the Project Description.

a. Submission of a collaborative proposal from one organization

The single proposal method allows investigators from two or more organizations who have developed an integrated research project to submit a single, focused proposal. A single investigator bears primary responsibility for the administration of the grant and discussions with NSF, and, at the discretion of the organizations involved, investigators from any of the participating organizations may be designated as co-PIs. Note, however, that if awarded, a single award would be made to the submitting organization, with any collaborators listed as subawards. (See Chapter II.C.2.g(vi)(e) for additional instructions on preparation of this type of proposal.)

If a proposed subaward includes funding to support postdoctoral researchers, the mentoring activities to be provided for such individuals must be incorporated in the supplemental mentoring plan outlined in Chapter II.C.2.j.

b. Submission of a collaborative proposal from multiple organizations

Simultaneous submission of proposals allows multiple organizations to submit a unified set of certain proposal sections, as well as information unique to each organization as specified below. All collaborative proposals arranged as separate submissions from multiple organizations must be submitted via FastLane. For these proposals, the project title must begin with the words ""Collaborative Research:ï¿½ If funded, each organization bears responsibility for a separate award.","NSF 24-543: Division of Environmental Biology","NSF 24-543","https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappg17_1/pappg_2.jsp#IID3",,,,,,,"No",,,,,,,,,,,,,100,"W04723357",,,,,"Female","Wyoming Coop Unit",300000007170004,"Anna Lisa D.

Permafrost plays a vital role in the global carbon cycle, and its thawing can release large quantities of greenhouse gasses, accelerating climate change. However, existing datasets lack the long-term historical context required to fully understand permafrost dynamics. We work to extend the temporal dimension of the permafrost dataset, offering valuable insights into the historical trends and better understanding how climate and permafrost changes are interlinked.
We aim to develop AI-based image processing techniques on digitized historical maps and excavating essential parameters such as surface topography, small ice/water body geometrics and other labeled features in maps that are important for tracking permafrost changes. Our methods will involve using convolutional neural networks to automate tasks such as georeferencing, contour mapping, texture analysis and pattern search, as well as recognizing written texts. Once extracted and validated, we will make this dataset compatible with geospatial tools and support existing efforts in permafrost spatial analysis using satellite imagery.
In alignment with the FAIR Data Principles, the dataset will be made Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR), ensuring it serves as a valuable, publicly available resource for the global climate research community. By filling a critical gap in permafrost data, this project will contribute to more accurate climate models and support long-term monitoring and adaptation strategies.

However, the committee will consider proposals for projects targeting those species if additional benefits to other species or their habitats are clearly articulated.  Although the all wildlife fund is the primary wgbglc funding source for projects focusing on pronghorn and state wildlife action plan (swap) priorities, the committee has chosen not to identify specific project or species priorities when accepting proposals.  The committee has funded projects that focus on research, monitoring, species or habitat restoration, equipment purchases, public outreach and education, and conservation easements, but retains the flexibility to entertain other requests.  Project funding derived from the wgbglc all wildlife fund sometimes accounts for a small, but important, component of larger projects and is often leveraged to obtain additional matching funds.  Funding awards from the all wildlife committee are generally less than $20,000.  Project proposals containing well-written narratives, clear and concise budgets, evidence of strong partnerships, and well-defined objectives and timelines for project completion have the best chance of funding.  Swap implementation projects should note the species of greatest conservation need most likely to benefit from the project and any relevant priorities identified in the swap that will be addressed.","Wyoming Governor's Big Game License Coalition",,"https://wgfd.wyo.gov/licenses-applications/commissioner-and-governor-licenses",,,,,,,"No",,,,,"0% - Per Cooperative Agreement # 1434-05HQRU1542",,,,,,,,100,"W04723357",,,,,"Female","Wyoming Coop Unit",300000007170004,"Anna Lisa D.
